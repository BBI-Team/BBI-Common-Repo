Looping :-
		In programming languages, loops are used to execute a set of instructions/functions repeatedly when some conditions become true. There are three types of loops in Java.

				1.for loop
				2.while loop
				3.do-while loop

	1.for loop: for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.
	
	
	2.while loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.
	
	3.A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
	
Break :-
		The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
		{
			if (i == 4) 
			{
				break;
			}
		  System.out.println(i);
		}
		
Continue :-
		The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
		{
			if (i == 4) 
			{
			continue;
			}
		  System.out.println(i);
		}
